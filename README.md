## Medi-Connect

Our Hospital Resource Management System streamlines resource sharing among hospitals, optimizing bed allocation, medicine distribution, and facilitating second opinions from specialists. Hospitals can easily view and offer available beds, share surplus medicines, and seek expert advice through secure channels. Additionally, the system enables coordinated emergency responses and provides valuable insights through data analytics. By promoting collaboration and efficiency, our software enhances patient care, reduces costs, and strengthens disaster preparedness within the healthcare system.
