An application facilitating the seamless sharing of resources, soliciting second opinions on diagnoses, and providing essential medical resources plays a pivotal role in enhancing patient care outcomes. By fostering interconnectedness among hospitals, such an app enables medical professionals to access critical resources promptly; commonly in times of emergency.
